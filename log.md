# 100 Days Of Code - Log
<br>

---

## Day 1 : July 20, Thursday

### **Today's progress :**
- Learned how to Make and connect an API project to a database
    - I made a NodeJS API project and connected it to MongoDB
    - I made the schema

### **Thoughts :**
This took longer than I exprected to learn. And I learned to alocate more time to learning and coding new concepts into my projects
